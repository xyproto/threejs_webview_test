# threejs_webview_test

Testing the combination of webview and threejs.

This package uses:

* [webview](https://github.com/zserge/webview) in combination with
* [onthefly](https://github.com/xyproto/onthefly) and
* [threejs](https://threejs.org/)

WebGL does not seem to work in webview yet, so there will only be a white window showing up.
